**1. Pandas

Pandas is a library in Python that provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis. Pandas is commonly used to create tables, change data dimensions, check data, and so on. The basic data structure in Pandas is called DataFrame, which makes it easy for us to read a file with many types of formats such as .txt, .csv, and .tsv files. This feature will make it a table and can also process data using operations such as join, distinct, group by, aggregation, and other techniques found in SQL.
